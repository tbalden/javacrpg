Welcome to the world of perils, Adventurer!\n
You have been wandering around these lands since you left your master, never stopping
for more than a few days all the way.  You know some of the dangers that
are lurking these lands, but no one can tell exactly what lies ahead.
You're lucky enough to have a world map at your disposal. Look out for nearby populations. Be aware
that some of the races will not tolerate your presence around themselves.\n
Explore the lands, overcome your enemies, seek fortune and fame, or whatever. 
Anyway, fulfil your destiny!
