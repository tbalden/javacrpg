Welcome, Adventurer!\n
You have been wandering around these lands since you left your Masters, stopping for naught but a few days of rest throughout the journey. Shrines, as the one where you currently abide, have proven themselves usefull, as you can rest undisturbed.\n
You know some of the dangers that await, but none can tell what lies ahead. Your guts sense the watching eyes in the surrounding world, telling you: Be careful with your steps!\n
You're lucky enough to have a world map at your disposal. Look out for nearby populations. Be aware that some of the races will not tolerate your presence.\n
Explore the lands, overcome your enemies, seek fortune and fame, or do whatever the hell you want.\n
Fulfill your destiny!
