Installing and Running JCRPG
-----------------------------

First, install Sun JRE 1.5 or later on your PC. (use your distribution's repository or download at http://java.sun.com)
Optionally you can use OpenJDK 6+ (available under different Linux distributions like Ubuntu).
Then download jcrpg from http://sf.net/projects/javacrpg downloads. Unpack, and run jcrpg executable.
Configure config.properties if you experience low FPS. (Set low RENDER_DISTANCE, RENDER_GRASS_DISTANCE.)

Requirements:

- Around 350MB free RAM with default config
- Opengl accelerated videocard
- X11 or Windows or MacOS
- Sound card

Configure RENDER_DISTANCE and VIEW_DISTANCE, far view and shaders if want to lower memory requirement or run out of memory. :-)
