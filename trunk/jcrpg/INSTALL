Installing and Running JCRPG


First, install Sun JRE 1.5 or later on your PC.
Then download jcrpg. Unpack, and run jcrpg executable.
Configure config.properties if you experience low FPS. (Set low RENDER_DISTANCE, RENDER_GRASS_DISTANCE.)

Requirements:

- Around 350MB free RAM with default config
- Opengl accelerated videocard
- X11 or Windows or MacOS

Configure RENDER_DISTANCE and VIEW_DISTANCE if want to lower memory requirement or run out of memory. :-)
