VLC is a player but also can be used to record a screen cast ( capture the screen as video).Here is the small how to do that. This works with portable VLC too.
Start the VLC By going to the installation folder and running the command
>> vlc screen://
It will open the VLC and shows the screen exactly. It actually is streaming the screen

Now go to File and select Wizard

Select the option Transcode and Save the file. And click next

Select the option existing playlist and select screen:// to record



Give the name of the file you want the screencast to be saved as (don’t have to give file extn)

Now VLC is recording your screenactivities.Minimize the VLC and do what you want to do.When you want to stop it. Click on the stop button. You will have the video saved at the location
given by you above.
