------------------------------------------

[ ] World generator
	parameterized cool world generation!
	[ ] hash based geo placing through a map (like static HashMap), if two geo block is similar, join them into one geo (?)
	[X] ocean gen -> add likeness to stick landmass together that modifies the likeness at maginfication*3 zones for example (it will comb together some parts as a landmass - modifier)
		[X] too levels of stickiness? it is too squarelike right now (use two intersecting magnification zones!)
	[X] add climate
	[ ] add Geography areas TO ONE GEO'S BOUNDARY instead of many new items!
		[ ] Mountain!!
	[-] use filesystem to store world instead of memory?
	[X] bit based Boundaries

[ ] plants inside -> color is wrongly set to outside quad color
	[ ] with inside flora cave limiter walls is not working (maybe OUTSIDE cube is detected because of the flora cube??)

[ ] moving N-S should be limited on map edge!  

[ ] UI worldmap	
	[ ] geographies
	[ ] cities... 
[ ] UI transparent text box in the middle bottom, small contrast fonts, transparent, like FPSnode (take a look at that one!)

[ ] climate
	[ ] swamp , savana climate belt
	[ ] climate levels: SNOW limit to the mountains
	[ ] climate related events -> snowing, rain, UI messages
	[ ] seasonal models for plants 

[ ] living things foundations -
	[ ] !! Boundary based, not really moving, only when you enter the boundary !! -> for turns they can interoperate in their intersecting boundaries! quasi random seed based events / turn
	[ ] a common entity engine will process the happenings turn based
	[ ] Generator needed for start out - later reproduction system for animals/humans? 
	[ ] hierarchy -> dynamic, boundaries added together, processed to the top of the hierarchy -> events possible on every level of living example: country <-> city population <-> guards etc.
	[ ] entering domain in a given turn will trigger possibilities for you to start skill based processes -> trying to hunt down animals in the domain, or avoiding a group of bandits there


[ ] Wildlife should be generated based on Flora percentage given by flora generators??
	[ ] Wildlife -> animal kingdom with a chain of predating, complex fauna interaction rethinking


[X] Farview render -> only every 5th, 10th, and multiply its scale with it (5 or 10)!
	[ ] make it better with big gaps (non 1)
	[ ] no inside farview from outside! and vica versa?
	[ ] don't load twice as much when farview...more terrain loaded, farview distance param? 

[ ] bounding box oct tree cull -> render much bigger parts? non-always-culling part - subpart of view distance -> if something out of it -> always cull
		if non culled out of render distance -> new render- ---- less loading and such, more memory! think about it
[ ] pool the geom batches, do not use add/remove instance


[ ] lamp key, to switch on/off lamp in the dark!
	[ ] spot light to the user in the night, doesnt work!!

[ ] mountain steep walk bug to one direction walk
[ ] quicken loading of Cubes in Geography etc. 
 


[ ] occluder invisible quad to the tree middle top -> billboard it but in 90 to the camera so you cannot see it, but occluding! :-)
[ ] bumpmapped texture disappear in the night! ?? checkout jme source?
		

[ ] clean up climate and implement all parts of it with conditions, continue the work on it
[ ]	implement changing 3d models, how (updating some of the rendered nodes)? 
[ ] rain, fog, snow?


[ ] skySphere change: night sky based on calculated light value (v)
[ ] cloud planes on sky

[ ] add Harek's table to the house

[?] sea

[?] Lod modelling trees with billboard images captured in blender!
[?] Tree generation in java code? (billboard leaf quads!)
[?] Write the wind vertex program? Now it's cpu based!
[?] lens flare too intensive with bloom -> check what's to be done - no way to improve yet :-/

--
[-] UI
	[X] loading Icon disc
	[X] UI should now be started. Keybindings for views, etc.
	[X] World Map - other menu key binding system - start it in UIBase!
	[X] world map! quick run through the ocean and waters + big geos -> create an image
		[X] more detailed

[X] Bug: moving from world limit -> displays contents behind back

[X] redesign Coordinate system -> totally bad when moving around...shouldn't have all increasing X/Y/Z -> cut down
		but this makes rendering totally bad!
[X] when viewing onto border of globe not showing cubes -> J3DCore TODO fix!	

[X] far view optimizatios for trees? display less tree in the far?
[-] far view replacement of cubes with sg else to look better...a grey plane?

[X] waters rivers, lakes -> add Water superclass, semi inteligent, looking for surface adding river bad if surface, sides, waterfalls
	[X] rivers
	[X] lakes

[-] narrowing quad sized bb part models for pine?

[X] multilevel surface -> use all the surfaces!

[X] Cave: implement surface interface! multilevel cave??
	[X] climate -> inside and outside flora!

[X] jme 1.0 Buffer - Render problem

[-] vertex program jumps -> add camPost to local param and add it to vertex.position before calc
	[X] moving all around when passing
[X] water reflection -> undetailed SUN and MOON too not just skySphere!

[X] Cave: too much side meshes!? how to join them? geomBatch?? 2500 meshes -> 20fps?? smaller view dist for them (model level for rendertoview)?

[-] shadow error, killin render pass
[-] add two phase render to all CKeyAction

[X] wrong billboarding , fix it...on long view distance it is too slow LODding on moving

[X] cherry foliage
[X] wall can be seen inside because of camera point of view too close -> restructure walls to the middle of the node??

[X] when ground from obj model, create new randomly changing RenderedSide with several models 
[-] normal or parallax map to ground !

[X] Charlie's report:
	[X] - grass on hill steep
	[X]	- if view distance is low, caves are very blue inside
	[?]	- if I run into a tree, I often can't turn left until I first turn right
	[X]	- view distance needs combining with fog so things don't "appear" out of nowhere

[X] billboard rotated of foliage upon looking left right very ugly! maybe adding more negation in TrimeshGeomBatch, test it?
[X] fog shader
[X] wind animation shader!

[X] grass to GeometryBatch
	[X] common GeometryBatch for grass -> less object creation?
	[X] billboarding
	[X] animation to grass! shader??
	
[X] quad_bb_tree to GeomBatch with TrimeshGeomBatch, BillboardPartVegetation
	[-] remove batch from treenode's rotation/translation to a pool or something, to make it billboardable?
	[X] do not rotate the parent node of tree, but rotate subnodes, except for trimeshBatchGeom!!!!
	[X] animation??  

[X] lens flare effect lost with new invisible bounding spheres and new geombatch thing
	[X] remove skyrootnode, add the sun directly to ground?

[X] add lowest texture detail for low end cards usable FPS
	[X] test

[X] culling bug!

[X] cave into the mountain!
	[X] settable empty space for entrance cave -> not only one cube at the edge!
	[X] settable level highness, levels that belong together, share the same block/empty pattern
	[X] optimization -> if in cave, display only cave cubes, and some distance of other cubes?
	[X] cave lighting
	[X] use hash rotated side
	[X] flare is visible through the caves! intRootNode to a common parent with extRootNode

[X] looking left / right like up / down
[X] clean up files in SVN
[X] user manual update
[-] if no grass, don't put it on node!
[-] separate thread for render
[X] differentiate angle of renderToViewPort for turning and for normal view mode (parameterized) -> less models
[X] push models back to pool and use Placeholder based on turn / view direction!!
	[X] turning is not right yet
[X] culling problem with reused nodes!!!

[X] tree normal vectors, too blocky trees! try with exported obj models!
	[X] too dark trees now! -> mtl file firs 3 values "Ka" set to 0.500000 !


[X] new pooling -> update shadow occluder activation!!

[X] model pool ageing and clearing later
[X] model pool perfection -> some nodes doesn't display after render!! quad vegetation displays on steeps!!

[X]  MODEL POOL BASED ON VIEW DISTANCE, NOT ON RENDER DISTANCE!! (less memory)
	use with pseoudo nodes!! that are only placed on the scenario to be replaced with real PoolNodes from
		Model pool! The pool will load a node if necessary! renderToViewPort will use the ModelPool, not the
		render part!

[X] jungle big tree - covering all, greens on it?
[X] jungle bush
[X] reinvent renderArea, magnifications?? need distant view too
[X] optimize j3dcore render/renderside (based on profile.txt) to make 
	usable on 15+ DISTANCE with moving too! (3d part is okay now with 6200go)
[-] memory eater -> quadbillboard is not fine enough...eats memory, caching it solved!
[X] Shadow occluder number too much -> hashSet, get distance on every render/ remove add them
[X] update LWJGL/JME from repository
[X] BillboardPartModel with more quads for Lowest detail, math for more quads, 
	add LOD level 3 for single quad
[-] nicer low detail textures for acacia png -> replaced with original texture
[X] billboard ngplant trees, hashmap based, BillboardPartsModel
[X] billboarding the grass! (rotation didnt help! :/)
[X] shadow render pass added! :-)
[-] Naive vegetation development? -> billboarding?? - Quad in other apps too!
[X] darkening veg -> mesh? or what?

[X] redraw Window model, it's too detailed on the lower part, unnecessarily
[X] grass kinds, sophisticated FloraSetup things!
[X] steeper mountain side is buggy with corners!!!

[X] CKeyAction camera settings, bad when looking up/down!

[X] finalize trees, create low level flora
[-] Test ImposterModel on FBO system
[-] ? Strip green from trees, create new Model type, SimpleTreeModel. Would define texture spatial type, plane.
	alpha state, texture etc.

[X] transparent texture finally working! Put some on the trees, collect some in your next journey to the wild ;)
[X] use LODModels!

[X] LODModel -> distanceSwitchedNode -> jungle, increase FPS with less detailed models
[X] ImposterNode http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=imposternode - lowest detail - rendered
[X] Billboard http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=billboardnode&s=billboard
	

[X] lens flare!
[X] orbiter Suns/Moons each should have own Light direction (see j3dCore for more details on TODO)


[X] Time in engine -> skybox..

[X] jungle middle flora -> leaves, desert cactus model :)
[X] fall down where no GroundSubType! to steep for example!!
[X] Hill_steep.3ds is wrongly rotated! After that fix Mountain.java to user correct SIDES[] for steeps of diff. 
	directions. Then complete Movement Blocking in j3dcore for Climbing.
	
[X] Weather engine - implement Climate -> fauna - climate condition based forest/plain!
	[ ] Change flag for rendered thing!? -> example: climate change callback for already generated parts?


[X] mountain -> steep display all around a new ground level - movement up ahead on it!! + unpassable rockside generation
[X] bug in Globe mode -> houses dont display going round ?
[X] Rendered continuous side bug!

[X] Magnification of Area implementation -> Place will define its magnification RATIO which is used to determine subplaces exact coordinates in a
	far more bigger area to move in!

[ ] world -> ai, place, object, faune, flora

[X] InputHandler -> create classic keyboard movement/turning which calls J3DCore render area renewal too
