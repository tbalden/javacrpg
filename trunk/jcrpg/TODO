--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] char sheet -> resistance values!

[ ] leveling of group (not fragment -> it can be joined etc., don't  persist such things in fragment!)
	overall organization level should be increased -> organization level means tougher units on generation
	 	some kind of randomization!
	[ ] elaborate GeneratedMemberInstance leveling - attributes/skills and profession, skill act forms

[ ] particle effect for models
[?] camera bigger view - switch off back rendered models (check cave)

[ ] cursed weapons - how can they stick upon use?

[ ] group targetted skill act forms...

[ ] check wciow updates on glestanimals - animated ? 


[ ] skill act form choice AI more complex -> choose different skills, and use positive forms too on friendly units.
	[ ] AI use of potions/objects too!

[ ] enemy unit effect icons too
	[ ] Confuse effect -> EvaluatorBase or EncounterLogic should mix up attacked units
	
[ ] summoning spells	

[ ] natural Talent addProfessionWithFilter for EntityDescription - to filter out some spell forms a monster
	doesnt have.


[X] adding a separate Turn Act view -> zoom into a plain grounded place - using the cube where player
	standed , generate a place with objects similar tile types etc.
	X Add a new RootNode for that scenario and generate + switch to it.
	X in combat mode turning + zooming on active units
	
	[X] light states -> external not so working
	[X] spell effects doesnt show ---> only on STEEPS!!!!!
	[x]	angle - looking back is not correct, some rendered parts not rendered, OPTIMIZE_ANGLE???

	[X] too quick anim at loads/start - a bit better now!
	[X] turn camera on actor
		[ ] real turn -> move it in background simpleUpdate?

	[ ] clear out center of battle ground - modify height variation as a Constructor parameter for plain
		- fix the seed for these generations somehow... now HashUtil's seed if changed battle ground may be bad!
		
	[ ] economics too!


[ ] world generation - concentrate friendly groups - don't let enemies close at start,
	tweak relation values against player? aggressivity should manipulate first sight relation to negative?

[X] a bigger 'Encounter' UI element popup when loading an encounter...
	[ ]light effect -> pull down lights, and then pull up on encounter grounds


sanity point for Morale is like mana for hp, limiting social skills!

[ ] NEUTRALIZED anim type use in EncLogic

##
[?] list before next release:
##

	[X] fix Interception window is not showing any time ?? encInfo calc is wrong or what?

	[X] adding different encounter grounds / climate


	[X] fix units not facing PARTY!!!!
		[X] spell direction isnt gOOD!!! -> it's not perfect but good

	[X] Helper Critical hit skills ? how use them (helper skills)
	
	[X] don't add multiple state effects, use the latest when Positive spell, use the severer when negative
		effect

	[X] Evaluator base
		[X] resistances etc. decreasing impact - EvaluatorBase - .evaluate() part's end
		[X] hit body parts, criticals
		[X] XP and impact calculation / 
		[X] armors on body parts calculation upon impact
		[X] member state effects - poison, sleep, etc.
			[X] add them when skill act form has such
				[X] updating them by turn 

	[-] ENHANCE INVENTORY
		[?] weapons - special 'filtering' equipping only should be added - no bodypart maximum dependency
			- in combat only those equipped should be used. If used and cursed it should be the only one. others
			should be removed, and until unequip with spell, it shouldn't be allowed to add another weapon.	
		[X] attach projectiles
		[X] move to other characters, with quantity
		[X] describe attachments upon selection a bow...
		
		[-] What about two handed fight?? --- ??? 
			[-] no such - maybe two handed weapon combos in One ObjInstance instead for two handed combat??
			

	[X] own unit effect icons + 
		[X] StateEffect has getIcon -> add some icon images
		[X] Characters.java -> add effect icon slots for portraits
		[X] add effect dont work on group!!! check icons too	
		[X] check duration/ is it okay under combat??buggy Resistance is too easy?? log something
		[X] remove with NORMAL Mode time too!

	[X] !! enemy sometimes cannot chose still living members -> unitData tells its dead!!
		test with longer combat now

	[X] special Use skill form beside the Do Nothing - make object / group selection possible, no skill act form
		[X] add healing potions (with bonus skillActForms - MinorHeal) 

	[X] you can turn around while in menu if moving just before the encounter begins!
		[X] use some Window is active check rather!!

	[X] hp - bug -> boar doesnt die on big damages done!
		[X] check logs, something is wrong - double impact calculations and such -> impact hashmap reused???

	[X] die messages
	
	[x] evaluation
		[X] potion use is not working!!
		[X] use newly created gatherer classes in EvaluatorBase for calculating each impact for each skillActForm / target member
			gather artifact bonus skills in the list beside the normal skill act form,
			iterate through them for each targetMember in the other list.
		
		[X] calc bonus of EQUIPPED (armors, rings) things in EntityObjInventory!
		
			
		[X] artifact bonus skill in turn act phase -> triggering and visualizing them - WolfTooth
			[X] effect program triggering is complete, impact calc NEEDED!
		[X] attribute plus addition to member attributes when using it for attack

	[X] filtering turn act target groups based on weapon range!
	[X] adding player characters to different lines based on party order 
	[X] filtering AI targets too by weapon range :)

	[X] equipped enhanced items should modify persistentMember's attributes/healthpoints... temporary values etc
		should be programmed.
	
	[X] inv/char sheet window restore not correct


	[X] check combat with non animated -> sounds etc.

	[X] reorder party from char sheet window -> swap button

	[X] projectiles with EffectProgram

	[X] arrow.blend from Zphr - use it instead of the tree! :)

	[X] SPELLS with particle effects

	[X] replenish HEP,STP etc. - 
		[X] normal mode Resting

	[X] Camp button doesn't work together with CKeyMenu definition!!

	[X] make Enemy check two way , get the worst case of the two way relationship to determine
		who is enemy who is friend!

	[X] LEVELING,
		[X] HEP,STP,SAP,MOP,MAP increasing on leveling based on attributes and level!
		[X] hud.characters bars are not updating correctly?? or current points are wrong

##

[X] ?switch to full angle rendering when starting a combat, and switch back after - better look around?

[X] battle lines - skill filtering based on target group lineup distance - member lineup distance
	
[-] check memory consumption! SOMEWHERE IT LEAKS!!!
	[-] PROBABLY PARTICLE EFFECT!!!
	
	[X] UI text is eating it away!!! --> CACHING?? better detaching? reuse
	[-] some other thing is too...


[X] combat idle anim!!

[X] exception (index out of bounds) in PositionMatrix iterator getNext in certain cases!! try it more, it must be buggy

[X] !! leveling !! for chars/entityMembers, points for them, 
    [X] bars on UI
	[X] EntityState, EntityMemberState further development

[X] death /point effects for encounter members


	[X] player death! -> 
		[X] set picture grayscale?
		
	[X] death animations
	[X] players health bars etc.
	


[X] particles, projectiles, boosting up spell tomes
[X] lock bug -> player can move in enc

[X] j3dmoving engine -> animation should be ended on time and regulated
	by j3dmoving engine - and EncounterLogic step should  call in j3dmoving if
	the event is finished for the step in 3d or it can wait more before moving to next encounter plan step.
	 (Interrupt possible later?) 


[-] EntityInstance -> group size - dying group members? how to count it in the instance's group data??
	----> don't count data, only in a turn act/encounter
	Randomizing should help that you won't meet so often groups that its too much overwhelming the number
	of encounters because of no 'positioned groups and group sizes'. So recalculated group sizes,
	and make it more random that the intersection meets who and how much! 
	
[o] initiating, collecting acts of members, and playing the plan in EncounterLogic
	[X] skill effects on points, skill success calculation

[X] use PlacementMatrix matrix to place scenario 
	[ ](colored OSD for different lines)...

	[ ] when the Turn Act begins, (after the encounter phase) all should be decided which side the given
	entities will take part: enemy or friend - neutral should be removed.
	Friendly units should be placed on left and right (also in ordered lines, so nearer can fight the front of the
	enemy) - like a plus to the own units, facing face-2-face the
	enemy. Enemy units should be placed in front (the nearer can attack directly, others shooting and magic!).
	An ordered placement list should be generated before starting the encounter for friendly units (1 to 3 lines)
	and in front of this an enemy ordere placement list (1 to 3 lines), after that should be placed the
	3d models and start the round. Movement -> how to animate? 
	
	each turn Neutralized (mentally or physically)  friendly/enemy units should be removed from the act -
	after that if someone is detained by player -> prison?payment for it for the player?
	
	A fight if won by neutralization should positively add to a relationship
	
[ ] try md5reader2 dot3 bump shader 

[X] more groups and single-type groups instead of one big groups with multi-types -> encounter phase view needs that
	[X] encounter 3d models -> one model should represent a group!!

[X] model viewer for md5, separate application

[X] owned infrastrucures are present now in a build of a population, and it is set as owned economic too...
 now 
	[ ] add "at home" state for PersistentEntities -> they should be found in one of their infrastructure, roaming boundary set to its position!

[X] alwaysIncludeFollowingMembers - in entityFragment should be used up in the list of selectables in TurnActWindow etc....

[X] entityMember perfecting for encounter calc in ecology
[X] TODO encounter info should have methods for size,
	and getListOfUnits!! refactor, windows too
	
	

[X] engine is not pausing in some encounter windows!!!!

[X] !!! PreEncounterWindow and EncounterWindow should be updated because now on
	EncounterInfo contains a list of EntityInstance fragments of different EntityInstances!!
	-> calculation of encounter point distance is now being done in Ecology, close encounters grouped together.

[X] inventory, character data sheet windows (F2,F3)
    [ ] perfection!


[ ] turnAct, encounter phase EncounterLogic - big development needed, plus 3D view + J3DMovingEngine combination...

    [ ] skill system: skill act forms for all skills, skill act form parameters!
    further skill design, how it will work!

[ ] entity ->
	[X]
		! Multiple RoamingBoundaries ! -> added a size parameter, an EntityInstance can be fragmented
		to do different things around, and can rejoin, RoamingBoundaries removed for that Fragment.
		
	[ ] implement split and rejoin! 
	
		If a group's fragment's size is lessening, it will be counted in its own fragment RoamingBoundaries
		till it rejoins group. -> this way we have little memory overhead for subgroups (and REMOVE the subEntities
		thing from EntityInstance). EntityMemberInstances (NPCs) can decide which fragment to follow.
		
	- Entities in alliances with other entities -> like in a town, commoners with fighters, nobles etc.
	(similar to Population -> Town integration)
		
[ ] Limiting access to "Population" and closed areas. The presence of an "overlapping boundary" (encounter) 
	does only count if a population zone's owner doesn't detect access (skill)/ it gives permission / 
	is friendly. Entities inside
	a Population won't meet a roaming unit until the population has power to defend the area. Entities inside
	can nominate defenders? 
	- Always register CurrentGeography in RoamingBoundaries of its fragment groups of an EntityInstance.
	- Checks -> upon a roaming boundary overlap of two entities Geography/ EConomics should be checked
	if they have a "defend" position. 
	This should be a new rule surely implemented to avoid encounters that are blocked by walls/economic or
	inaccessible areas.

[ ] inter-entity relations web

	[ ] add goals to groups / members based on entity relation qualities + automatically generated
		goals (colonization etc.), to make drive for different actions for groups.
	[ ] add some actions / outcomes that take place in encounters between groups and modifies relations
	
	[ ] generation -> add some conflicts, knowledge of other group's places etc. and goals
	
	--> this will lead to design encounter mode of player too 

	
[X] encounter screens, Interception, Encounter TurnAction windows


	[?] // TODO based on economic (house) heights add steps to the population
	
[X] TreeLocator.java
	[ ] //TODO this is not working correctly for a few cases, why?replaced with +1 for now

[X] skill based hud EntityOMeter
	[ ] -> only detected beings should be displayed

[ ] cave geo population -> rock rooms?


[ ] moving units not appearing over the other side of the world!!!??? - > coordinate calc is wrong I suppose


[ ] try to set fixed framerate


 [?] a giant 3d bitmap for explored area to make a local map charting work 

[ ] Skill tuner page with subframes - selecting a group of skills makes changing to those skill tuners - just like in Wiz7

[ ] social skills -> in a combat these people can throw their different skills into combat -> fighting other social skills
of the enemy or friend. We'll have to develop different 'words' for the different skills to make it really funny, and make 
a peaceful solution available in most of the cases.

[ ] possible portraits? http://search.freegamedev.net/artitems/tag/campaigns

[ ] rocks to mountain side with new RenderedHashGeneratedSides probably...


[?] gorilla model scaling -> walk in the air :-) recenter in blender?? -> fixed temp for gor only probably.

[ ] Combat !!!! 
	combat encounter -> regroup friendly units left/right flank of player!! :-) Enemies remain opposite of player. --- make possible to look around while combat! ;-)

[ ] ecology
    [ ] sophisticated generation -> geography, water food etc...
    [ ] foodchain - generation and per turn eat, plus multiplication etc.
    [ ] turn choice of AI, skills involved etc.
    [ ] moving of groups, fixed groups
  	[ ] hierarchy -> dynamic, boundaries added together, processed to the top of the hierarchy -> events possible on every level of living example: country <-> city population <-> guards etc.
	[ ] entering domain in a given turn will trigger possibilities for you to start skill based processes -> trying to hunt down animals in the domain, or avoiding a group of bandits there
	[ ] foodchain based generation, growing/decay, multiplication, new groups later ...
    
[ ] encounter system
    [ ] encounter choices, skills etc, UI elements
    [ ] combat - grouped, decisions etc., attribute + skill to lists

Groups:
	Dune/Wizardry like depersonalized groups moving around! Special NPC and such likely as part of groups.
	Hash sorted coordinates in a domain. Create moving cursors for humanoid communication. 
	Decisions made by player affect back through the group if depersonalized is subject.

[ ] encountered group -> actions done with them spread by turn basis in the whole group around. so in a few turns the whole big entityInstance group can become hostile or friendly

each entity will look for the groups nearby every turn. Even if the nearby entity have acted on it a new acting from itself is needed in every case.
The unit shall check if there is common intersection with more than one nearby entity and do a common act upon them in one act not two. In this
case it can use as much entity of it as the sum of the common radius would allow!! 
If they don't intersect do two separate act for each other nearby entity.


EntityGroups won't do sophisticated positioning when acting between themselves -> only ActionPoint based thing should be implemented. 

With player : PositionCalculus is used and extended for different Entities.

UI:
--
[ ] combat thingies...
[X] player choice window -> actions when meeting entities
[ ] UI detailed map

Moving:
------
[ ] j3dmovingengine
    http://jsourcery.com/api/captiveimagination.com/jmonkeyengine/02-05-2007/jmetest/renderer/TestMipMaps.source.html -> animated model
	[X] wildlife -> rangedBoundaries
	
	[ ] refactor of loadObjects in model loader , extend AnimatedModelNode with additional object nodes like weapon etc... 


World Generator:
---------------
[-] World generator
	parameterized cool world generation!
	
	[X] Geography GenerationProperty -> what to put on and what not, where to begin where not. Use implementation independent type references for FLOW_BEGIN, FLOW_END etc...
		[ ] sophisticate
		
	[X] rivers depending on oceans! ;-)
		
		[ ] ! River: if no river on two sides endside should be SIDE_NONE!!
			[ ] River end is too rocky in the sea?? check outside water (like geo getoutsideheightpoint, getOutsideWaterPoint)
		
	[ ] mountain bigger than blocks, trickier mountain algorithm. ?
	[ ] valley?
	[ ] lake
	
	[ ] creating "Territories/Areas" of geography -> bigger multiblock areas with DistanceBasedBoundaries! In generation process this can be done
	
	[ ] hash based geo placing through a map (like static HashMap), if two geo block is similar, join them into one geo (?)
	

Other:
-----


[ ] moving N-S should be limited on map edge!  
[?] movement in 8 direction! new blocker side type -> trees can be moved in between, walls cannot?


[ ] climate
	[ ] swamp , savana climate belt
	[ ] climate levels: SNOW limit to the mountains
	[ ] climate related events -> snowing, rain, UI messages
	[ ] seasonal models for plants
	[ ] detailed fruit object structure later and such!


[ ] Knowledge base Modularity -> things can have knowledge attached to it, which modifies the possibilities of players to handle them:
	plug knowledge about object/monsters/animals etc with the given
	object/being! Thus you can collect bonus info about them random
	scattered around the world, -- beat monsters more easy etc.

[ ] lamp key, to switch on/off lamp in the dark!
	[ ] spot light to the user in the night, doesnt work!!


[ ] occluder invisible quad to the tree middle top -> billboard it but in 90 to the camera so you cannot see it, but occluding! :-)
[ ] bumpmapped texture disappear in the night! ?? checkout jme source?
		

[ ] clean up climate and implement all parts of it with conditions, continue the work on it
[ ]	implement changing 3d models, how (updating some of the rendered nodes)? 
[ ] rain, fog, snow?

[ ] mineral system too to the caves etc.

[ ] skySphere change: night sky based on calculated light value (v)
[ ] cloud planes on sky

[ ] add Harek's table to the house


[?] quicken loading of Cubes in Geography etc. 
[?] Lod modelling trees with billboard images captured in blender!

-- ########## DONE ######################################################################################

[X] groups trespassed - icons - UI - EntityOMeter

[X] Population.java

	[X] population change -> how to modify renderedArea
		--> population updates happen in a cycle of X turns. Then a reload is done, clearing rendered
		area cache too

	[X] new idea -> population should be shared by different groups. groups can join a population migrating(?)
		Populations should be in center of fix sized "areas", no overlapping this way guaranteed, also
		if a population is over a size, it should migrate to another area, splitting up the group to
		[ ] a "settler" and remaining group. Looking for home :)

	[X] // TODO write a quick fitter function to build up a population structure quickly.
		[ ] Structure base class that can be extended telling how to build the street/building etc. structure
	
	[-] gather changed areas into a temporary list in an ecology turn to know if re-render is needed where player is standing.
	 -> instead Economic Update Turn was introduced


[X] Farview render -> only every 5th, 10th, and multiply its scale with it (5 or 10)!
	[X] make it better with big gaps (non 1)
	[-] no inside farview from outside! and vica versa?
	[X] don't load twice as much when farview...more terrain loaded, farview distance param? 

[-] bounding box oct tree cull -> render much bigger parts? non-always-culling part - subpart of view distance -> if something out of it -> always cull
		if non culled out of render distance -> new render- ---- less loading and such, more memory! think about it
[-] pool the geom batches, do not use add/remove instance


[X] performance decreasing with time! debug it, what eats what
	[-] map problem, load texture didn't help -> or maybe something else... releaseTexture didn't help, maybe not a map problem
	[X] audio system??
	
[X] farview problems -> left over of unneeded magnified farview models model geom batches, trees, all !! :-O

[?] mushroom quad size is not good, it's not scaled correctly!!!

[X] ui + flare showing!

[X] !! most important task !! single level beings is so LAME :)
 surface based model positioning in PlayerTurnLogic! multilevel

[X] preencounter window + !ListMultiSelect!

[X] ecology groups should generate economy (houses, lairs) in their home place
	[X] !!! sophisticate it to big sized communities, quicken loading -> arrays of houses instead of one house/group -> residential areas fully with algorithm
	[X] geography heights should be overridden!? it's all wrong now under the houses.
[X] setting groupingrule sizes makes the group give encounter sizes of 0 always!! change the calc method... (check gorillaHorde commented part)
	

[X] living things foundations -
	[X] !! Boundary based, not really moving, only when you enter the boundary !! -> for turns they can interoperate in their intersecting boundaries! quasi random seed based events / turn
	[X] a common entity engine will process the happenings turn based
	[X] Generator needed for start out - later reproduction system for animals/humans? 

[X] UI worldmap	
	[X] geographies -> !!! mountains/forests/plains different gray
	[X] cities... 
[X] UI transparent text box in the middle bottom, small contrast fonts, transparent, like FPSnode (take a look at that one!)
[X] ui element encounter predisplay -> icons representing the lifeform, ? icon if you cannot identify it/don't know it yet.

[X] mountain geography population -> geography pointheight should be averaged at the given area where the house is located.
    [-] -> logs for mountain huts with ladders instead of height modification

[X] camera rotating with turning to the back of the given cube reverse the faced direction, so trees and such can
	be seen.

[-]	replace model geom batch with a HeightMap -> addItem will set the height levels of a big Terrain, texture splatting??


[X] MEM EATER!! What's eating memory????

	[X] local map fixed
	[X] world map shouldn't be updating a full position image now, only repositioning a sign image quad!!
		[X] replace all with ImageGraphics - different imagegraphics transparents

[-] seemless movement -> batch add/remove takes too much time of the render


[X] light of the skysphere goes wrong with walking one direction a lot! lightnode or sg?


[X] local map on screen
 [X] develop it more, sides not just bottom
[X] common Profession extension for superclass of professions with pre-added normal skills available for any profession

[X] audio support


[X] continental trees should have a more random trunk, not so vertical as it is now

[X] Separate thread for updating audio!
 
[X] Main Menu window!
j3dcore simpleInitGame's end:
// TODO do not call init3DGame - instead view Main Menu window - create it. It will use SaveLoadNew class for game creation, and it will
// call init3DGame. 

[-] portraits, and character creation in new Game window


[X] loading twice results an empty blue screen -> moving makes it good again, culling problem!?

[X] sea
[-] lens flare too intensive with bloom -> check what's to be done - no way to improve yet :-/
[X] Write the wind vertex program? Now it's cpu based!
[-] Tree generation in java code? (billboard leaf quads!)

[-] Wildlife should be generated based on Flora percentage given by flora generators??
	[X] Wildlife -> animal kingdom with a chain of predating, complex fauna interaction rethinking


[X] shadow not appearing! -> because of HUD quad node!

[X] Farview -> render for farview into a different Render Cube array, using the new farView thing in getCube!! Use this in the renderToViewport far part
	[X] farview Y % 4 !

[X] blender STEEP rock and steep other nicer
[X] cave total rewrite needed, especially the entrance and size part! -> make usable with new mountain / valley+underplain?
[X] river review -> mountain gives elements that not existed before

[X] RenderedClimateChangingSide

[X] Ocean -> where to put +/- of height in plain...water is bad!
[X] mountain steep cliff!
	[X] steep rock element for mountain/valley!!
	[-] corner,intersect -> grass on it?? cubic form of grass more sophistication in FloraListElement?

[X] mountain steep walk bug to one direction walk

[X] merging two cubes doesnt seem to work! (when no overwrite)


	[X] ocean gen -> add likeness to stick landmass together that modifies the likeness at maginfication*3 zones for example (it will comb together some parts as a landmass - modifier)
		[X] too levels of stickiness? it is too squarelike right now (use two intersecting magnification zones!)
	[X] add climate
	[X] add Geography areas TO ONE GEO'S BOUNDARY instead of many new items!
		[X] Mountain!!
		
	[-] use filesystem to store world instead of memory?
	[X] bit based Boundaries

[X] Cave -> 1 sized wrong at some places
	[X] no internal flora is appearing!!
	[X] no entrance where you can't enter -> isCaveEmpty() hash

[X] plants inside -> color is wrongly set to outside quad color
	-> this will need some further work as models are pooled and also batched

[X] with inside flora cave limiter walls is not working (maybe OUTSIDE cube is detected because of the flora cube??)

[-] UI
	[X] loading Icon disc
	[X] UI should now be started. Keybindings for views, etc.
	[X] World Map - other menu key binding system - start it in UIBase!
	[X] world map! quick run through the ocean and waters + big geos -> create an image
		[X] more detailed

[X] Bug: moving from world limit -> displays contents behind back

[X] redesign Coordinate system -> totally bad when moving around...shouldn't have all increasing X/Y/Z -> cut down
		but this makes rendering totally bad!
[X] when viewing onto border of globe not showing cubes -> J3DCore TODO fix!	

[X] far view optimizatios for trees? display less tree in the far?
[-] far view replacement of cubes with sg else to look better...a grey plane?

[X] waters rivers, lakes -> add Water superclass, semi inteligent, looking for surface adding river bad if surface, sides, waterfalls
	[X] rivers
	[X] lakes

[-] narrowing quad sized bb part models for pine?

[X] multilevel surface -> use all the surfaces!

[X] Cave: implement surface interface! multilevel cave??
	[X] climate -> inside and outside flora!

[X] jme 1.0 Buffer - Render problem

[-] vertex program jumps -> add camPost to local param and add it to vertex.position before calc
	[X] moving all around when passing
[X] water reflection -> undetailed SUN and MOON too not just skySphere!

[X] Cave: too much side meshes!? how to join them? geomBatch?? 2500 meshes -> 20fps?? smaller view dist for them (model level for rendertoview)?

[-] shadow error, killin render pass
[-] add two phase render to all CKeyAction

[X] wrong billboarding , fix it...on long view distance it is too slow LODding on moving

[X] cherry foliage
[X] wall can be seen inside because of camera point of view too close -> restructure walls to the middle of the node??

[X] when ground from obj model, create new randomly changing RenderedSide with several models 
[-] normal or parallax map to ground !

[X] Charlie's report:
	[X] - grass on hill steep
	[X]	- if view distance is low, caves are very blue inside
	[?]	- if I run into a tree, I often can't turn left until I first turn right
	[X]	- view distance needs combining with fog so things don't "appear" out of nowhere

[X] billboard rotated of foliage upon looking left right very ugly! maybe adding more negation in TrimeshGeomBatch, test it?
[X] fog shader
[X] wind animation shader!

[X] grass to GeometryBatch
	[X] common GeometryBatch for grass -> less object creation?
	[X] billboarding
	[X] animation to grass! shader??
	
[X] quad_bb_tree to GeomBatch with TrimeshGeomBatch, BillboardPartVegetation
	[-] remove batch from treenode's rotation/translation to a pool or something, to make it billboardable?
	[X] do not rotate the parent node of tree, but rotate subnodes, except for trimeshBatchGeom!!!!
	[X] animation??  

[X] lens flare effect lost with new invisible bounding spheres and new geombatch thing
	[X] remove skyrootnode, add the sun directly to ground?

[X] add lowest texture detail for low end cards usable FPS
	[X] test

[X] culling bug!

[X] cave into the mountain!
	[X] settable empty space for entrance cave -> not only one cube at the edge!
	[X] settable level highness, levels that belong together, share the same block/empty pattern
	[X] optimization -> if in cave, display only cave cubes, and some distance of other cubes?
	[X] cave lighting
	[X] use hash rotated side
	[X] flare is visible through the caves! intRootNode to a common parent with extRootNode

[X] looking left / right like up / down
[X] clean up files in SVN
[X] user manual update
[-] if no grass, don't put it on node!
[-] separate thread for render
[X] differentiate angle of renderToViewPort for turning and for normal view mode (parameterized) -> less models
[X] push models back to pool and use Placeholder based on turn / view direction!!
	[X] turning is not right yet
[X] culling problem with reused nodes!!!

[X] tree normal vectors, too blocky trees! try with exported obj models!
	[X] too dark trees now! -> mtl file firs 3 values "Ka" set to 0.500000 !


[X] new pooling -> update shadow occluder activation!!

[X] model pool ageing and clearing later
[X] model pool perfection -> some nodes doesn't display after render!! quad vegetation displays on steeps!!

[X]  MODEL POOL BASED ON VIEW DISTANCE, NOT ON RENDER DISTANCE!! (less memory)
	use with pseoudo nodes!! that are only placed on the scenario to be replaced with real PoolNodes from
		Model pool! The pool will load a node if necessary! renderToViewPort will use the ModelPool, not the
		render part!

[X] jungle big tree - covering all, greens on it?
[X] jungle bush
[X] reinvent renderArea, magnifications?? need distant view too
[X] optimize j3dcore render/renderside (based on profile.txt) to make 
	usable on 15+ DISTANCE with moving too! (3d part is okay now with 6200go)
[-] memory eater -> quadbillboard is not fine enough...eats memory, caching it solved!
[X] Shadow occluder number too much -> hashSet, get distance on every render/ remove add them
[X] update LWJGL/JME from repository
[X] BillboardPartModel with more quads for Lowest detail, math for more quads, 
	add LOD level 3 for single quad
[-] nicer low detail textures for acacia png -> replaced with original texture
[X] billboard ngplant trees, hashmap based, BillboardPartsModel
[X] billboarding the grass! (rotation didnt help! :/)
[X] shadow render pass added! :-)
[-] Naive vegetation development? -> billboarding?? - Quad in other apps too!
[X] darkening veg -> mesh? or what?

[X] redraw Window model, it's too detailed on the lower part, unnecessarily
[X] grass kinds, sophisticated FloraSetup things!
[X] steeper mountain side is buggy with corners!!!

[X] CKeyAction camera settings, bad when looking up/down!

[X] finalize trees, create low level flora
[-] Test ImposterModel on FBO system
[-] ? Strip green from trees, create new Model type, SimpleTreeModel. Would define texture spatial type, plane.
	alpha state, texture etc.

[X] transparent texture finally working! Put some on the trees, collect some in your next journey to the wild ;)
[X] use LODModels!

[X] LODModel -> distanceSwitchedNode -> jungle, increase FPS with less detailed models
[X] ImposterNode http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=imposternode - lowest detail - rendered
[X] Billboard http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=billboardnode&s=billboard
	

[X] lens flare!
[X] orbiter Suns/Moons each should have own Light direction (see j3dCore for more details on TODO)


[X] Time in engine -> skybox..

[X] jungle middle flora -> leaves, desert cactus model :)
[X] fall down where no GroundSubType! to steep for example!!
[X] Hill_steep.3ds is wrongly rotated! After that fix Mountain.java to user correct SIDES[] for steeps of diff. 
	directions. Then complete Movement Blocking in j3dcore for Climbing.
	
[X] Weather engine - implement Climate -> fauna - climate condition based forest/plain!
	[ ] Change flag for rendered thing!? -> example: climate change callback for already generated parts?


[X] mountain -> steep display all around a new ground level - movement up ahead on it!! + unpassable rockside generation
[X] bug in Globe mode -> houses dont display going round ?
[X] Rendered continuous side bug!

[X] Magnification of Area implementation -> Place will define its magnification RATIO which is used to determine subplaces exact coordinates in a
	far more bigger area to move in!

[ ] world -> ai, place, object, faune, flora

[X] InputHandler -> create classic keyboard movement/turning which calls J3DCore render area renewal too
