Welcome to the world of perils, Adventurer!\n
You have been wandering around these lands since you left your master, never stopping for more than a few days all the way.  You know some of the dangers that are lurking these lands, but none of you can tell exactly what lies ahead. Your guts sense the watching eyes in the surrounding world, telling you: Be careful of your steps!\n
You're lucky enough to have a world map at your disposal. Look out for nearby populations. Be aware that some of the races will not tolerate your presence around themselves.\n
Explore the lands, overcome your enemies, seek fortune and fame, or whatever.\n\n
Fulfil your destiny!
