Welcome to the world of perils, Adventurer!\n
You have been wandering around these lands since you left your Masters. Not stopping more than for resting a few days all through the journey.  You know some of the dangers that await, but no one can tell what lies ahead. Your guts sense the watching eyes in the surrounding world, telling you: Be careful with your steps!\n
You're lucky enough to have a world map at your disposal. Look out for nearby populations. Be aware that some of the races will not tolerate your presence around themselves.\n
Explore the lands, overcome your enemies, seek fortune and fame, or whatever you care for.\n
Fulfill your destiny!
