Java Classic Role Playing Game
------------------------------

m. Movement/Keyboard

W/S/A/D for turning, moving.
Q/E for strafe.
Up/Down for looking up and down.

ESC to exit the demo.


c. Configuration

config.properties:
The optimal VIEW_DISTANCE is around 30-40 and RENDER_DISTANCE can be set to the double of these values. 
Take care of the -Xmx parameter in your jcrpg.sh/jcrpg.bat if you receive OutOfMemory or Heap is full.
If you have less memory for testing set smaller VIEW_DISTANCE and RENDER_DISTANCE in 
the config.properties file.
Use BLOOM_EFFECT and SHADOWS set to true if you have a decent PC (CPU and GPU). 
You can get additional FPS with turning Grass of (set RENDER_GRASS_DISTANCE=0) and turning 
MIPMAP_GLOBAL=true. Set TEXTURE_QUALITY_HIGH=false for even more FPS and less mem use.

r. Requirements
- Java Runtime Environment from java.sun.com under Windows/Linux or MacOSX (MacOSX not tested)
- At least ~300-400 megabyte free system memory, more if you set higher RENDER_DISTANCE/VIEW_DISTANCE 
	in config.properties
- Opengl accelerated video card (nvidia geforce 6200 or better should be good)
- Processor around 1.6GHz (Single core will do it)
