s. Starting the game

You need Sun's Java runtime environment to run the game. (See INSTALL.) Under Windows 64-bit you should use the 32-bit version 
of the Java, the 64-bit version cannot load the 64-bit dlls correctly for some reason. Linux 64-bit works. 
For starting under Linux and Mac use jcrpg.sh, under Windows use jcrpg.bat.

m. Movement/Keyboard

W/S/A/D for turning, moving.
Q/E for strafe.
Up/Down for looking up and down.
Left/Right for looking around.
You can also use mouse for looking around in mouse look mode (use right click to switch to that mode.)

C  Camping (resting)

L Lamplight switch on/off

F1 World map - rounded dots show the populations/mazes & different colors for the different geographic zones.
F2 Party behavior window (no effect of the settings here currently)
F3 Character Sheet window
F4 Character's Inventory window
F5 Party Order window
F6 Use Skill/Item window

F10 Main menu - here you can start a new game, exit, save, load the game and also set options.

T debug info about bufferpool
F11 debug infos (memory / 3d related)
F12 Take a screenshot

Use main menu for Save/Load your game.

Use Inventory window (F4) to attach arrows to bows, equip armors, give items to other characters, drop items.
Use Character Sheet (F3) to view you characters' attributes,resistance, active (spell) effects, XP, level, skill levels.
Use Use Skill/Item window (F6) to use items (e.g. potions), cast spell (e.g. healing).

To start a brand new game with new character use New Game in main menu, create new characters, fill up your party
and start the game! Use main menu to Save and Load your game. You can save only in Normal mode (not during combat).

Use key C (Camp) if you want to rest and replenish. You should do it at safe places for effective replenishing. Shrines are most safe for camping.
Right click to switch between mouselook and cursor. Use mouse to access top buttons.
You can click left/right on character portraits for Inventory/Character Sheet.

c. Configuration

Use Options menu to modify settings and save them. Some of the settings will need restart of the game. If you note something is 
not working properly after that, restart the game. You can also try to revert to lowest predefined settings in the Options menu.

You can edit the file manually as well. Details below.

config.properties:
The optimal VIEW_DISTANCE is around 30-40 and RENDER_DISTANCE can be set to the double of these values. 
Take care of the -Xmx parameter in your jcrpg.sh/jcrpg.bat if you receive OutOfMemory or Heap is full.
If you have less memory for testing set smaller VIEW_DISTANCE and RENDER_DISTANCE in 
the config.properties file.
Use BLOOM_EFFECT and SHADOWS set to true if you have a decent PC (CPU and GPU). 
You can get additional FPS with turning Grass of (set RENDER_GRASS_DISTANCE=0) and turning 
MIPMAP_GLOBAL=true. Set TEXTURE_QUALITY_HIGH=false for even more FPS and less mem use.




r. Requirements
- Java Runtime Environment from java.sun.com under Windows/Linux or MacOSX (Apple releases it's own tweaked version
	of Java, use that one for jCRPG.)
	Optionally you can use OpenJDK 6+ (available under different Linux distributions like Ubuntu)
- At least ~500-600 megabyte free system memory, more if you set higher RENDER_DISTANCE/VIEW_DISTANCE 
	in config.properties
- Opengl accelerated video card (nvidia geforce 6200 or better should be good)
	It's recommended to switch off 3D accelerated desktop effects, it can slow down jcrpg on a low-end machine.
- Processor around 1.6GHz (Single core will do it)


Be careful: Anti Alias samples higher than 0 might not work on some systems, especially 
with Linux Intel opengl driver (tested, only works with 0).

How to install Java under ubuntu linux or debian linux?
-------------------------------------------------------
Type :
# sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre

This is tested and working under Ubuntu Hardy Heron.

Under Arch Linux type:
# su -
# pacman -S openjdk6



What to do if jcrpg is slow?
----------------------------

If you are testing JCRPG and it runs slow there are a few things you can check to improve performance.

Firstly there's config.properties in the root directory of the game that can be modified with a text editor. Things to care about in ascending order of impact on game aesthetics:

    * WATER_SHADER - turn it "false" for more FPS
    * RENDER_GRASS_DISTANCE - set it to 0 to switch of grass, this may help a lot in terms of FPS and memory usage too
    * TEXTURE_DETAIL - set it to 0 or 1 for low and middle settings, can be a big FPS and memory eater
    * DETAILED_TREES - set it to false for less detailed trees with less foliage
    * VIEW_DISTANCE - a really large factor in FPS - as much as in the look of the game. Set to lower values for bigger FPS
    * RENDER_DISTANCE - helps out the loading and the memory usage - big memory usage may load the Java VM too. Set it to lower values, especially if you have little memory
    * RENDER_DISTANCE_FARVIEW - the higher this is the more memory and CPU/GPU it will consume rendering it. If using far view a sane value is used to be VIEW_DISTANCE/RENDER_DISTANCE/RENDER_DISTANCE_FARVIEW = 26/52/80. You will be able to see ~ 13 cubes distance detailed plus 27 cubes distance undetailed tiles magnified/simplified.
    * FARVIEW_ENABLED - set it to false, will help a great lot, cutting down the whole far view part

Second you can have hogging problems if you set high detail values and Java runs with low memory parameters 
or your system has small free memory. If you plan to run on high settings you may consider edit 
jcrpg.bat or jcrpg.sh and modify the -Xmx parameter to a higher value. (Example: -Xmx300m.) 
I recommend you to have at least 500MB free memory or more for the current default configuration (oct 2009).

Thirdly you may try to run it in lower resolutions - this can help a lot too.

How to check out latest SVN development code and how to run it?
---------------------------------------------------------------

SVN is for subversion - a concurrent versions system for developers. 
If you want to check it, you should have sun java + svn tool from 
subversion's homepage installed, plus java ant toolkit to compile it. 
If you have these installed type

# svn co https://javacrpg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/javacrpg javacrpg

After go to root dir, and type 'ant'. It should compile and start it.
You will need apache-ant too.
