m. Movement/Keyboard

W/S/A/D for turning, moving.
Q/E for strafe.
Up/Down for looking up and down.
Left/Right for looking around.

C  Camping (resting)

F1 World map
F2 Party behavior window (no effect of the settings here currently)
F3 Character Sheet window
F4 Character's Inventory window
F5 Party Order window
F6 Use Skill/Item window

F10 Main menu - here you can exit the game.

F11 debug infos (memory / 3d related)
F12 Take a screenshot

Use main menu for Save/Load your game.

Use Inventory window to attach arrows to bows, equip armors, give items to other characters, drop items.
Use Character Sheet to view you characters' attributes,resistance, active (spell) effects, XP, level, skill levels.

To start a brand new game with new character use New Game in main menu, create new characters, fill up your party
and start the game! Use main menu to Save and Load your game. You can save only in Normal mode (not during combat).

Use key C (Camp) if you want to rest and replenish. You should do it at safe places for effective replenishing.

c. Configuration

config.properties:
The optimal VIEW_DISTANCE is around 30-40 and RENDER_DISTANCE can be set to the double of these values. 
Take care of the -Xmx parameter in your jcrpg.sh/jcrpg.bat if you receive OutOfMemory or Heap is full.
If you have less memory for testing set smaller VIEW_DISTANCE and RENDER_DISTANCE in 
the config.properties file.
Use BLOOM_EFFECT and SHADOWS set to true if you have a decent PC (CPU and GPU). 
You can get additional FPS with turning Grass of (set RENDER_GRASS_DISTANCE=0) and turning 
MIPMAP_GLOBAL=true. Set TEXTURE_QUALITY_HIGH=false for even more FPS and less mem use.




r. Requirements
- Java Runtime Environment from java.sun.com under Windows/Linux or MacOSX (MacOSX not tested)
	Optionally you can use OpenJDK 6+ (available under different Linux distributions like Ubuntu)
- At least ~400-500 megabyte free system memory, more if you set higher RENDER_DISTANCE/VIEW_DISTANCE 
	in config.properties
- Opengl accelerated video card (nvidia geforce 6200 or better should be good)
	It's recommended to switch of 3D accelerated desktop effects, it can slow down jcrpg.
- Processor around 1.6GHz (Single core will do it)


How to install Java under ubuntu linux or debian linux?
-------------------------------------------------------
Type :
# sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre

This is tested and working under Ubuntu Hardy Heron.



What to do if jcrpg is slow?
----------------------------

If you are testing JCRPG and it runs slow there are a few things you can check to improve performance.

Firstly there's config.properties in the root directory of the game that can be modified with a text editor. Things to care about in ascending order of impact on game aesthetics:

    * WATER_SHADER - turn it "false" for more FPS
    * RENDER_GRASS_DISTANCE - set it to 0 to switch of grass, this may help a lot in terms of FPS and memory usage too
    * TEXTURE_DETAIL - set it to 0 or 1 for low and middle settings, can be a big FPS and memory eater
    * DETAILED_TREES - set it to false for less detailed trees with less foliage
    * VIEW_DISTANCE - a really large factor in FPS - as much as in the look of the game. Set to lower values for bigger FPS
    * RENDER_DISTANCE - helps out the loading and the memory usage - big memory usage may load the Java VM too. Set it to lower values, especially if you have little memory
    * RENDER_DISTANCE_FARVIEW - the higher this is the more memory and CPU/GPU it will consume rendering it. If using far view a sane value is used to be VIEW_DISTANCE/RENDER_DISTANCE/RENDER_DISTANCE_FARVIEW = 26/52/80. You will be able to see ~ 13 cubes distance detailed plus 27 cubes distance undetailed tiles magnified/simplified.
    * FARVIEW_ENABLED - set it to false, will help a great lot, cutting down the whole far view part

Second you can have hogging problems if you set high detail values and Java runs with low memory parameters 
or your system has small free memory. If you plan to run on high settings you may consider edit 
jcrpg.bat or jcrpg.sh and modify the -Xmx parameter to a higher value. (Example: -Xmx200m.) 
I recommend you to have at least 300MB free memory or more for the current default configuration (dec 2007).

Thirdly you may try to run it in lower resolutions - this can help a lot too.



What is jcrpg?
--------------

Here stands the brief feature list of the Java Classic RPG framework and the reference game.

Complete features:

- Classic tile based world view in opengl 3D
- Neoclassic simple mountains with 45 degree slopes
- Cave with various parameters (height, size, density, levels)
- Plains, forests
- Classic keyboard input with four direction movement
- Neoclassic look around in 45 degrees.
- Changing day and night with orbiters and optional lighting and route parameters
- Climate with belts
- Flora engine with climate dependency: continental, jungle, desert and arctic implemented
- Configurable graphics detail level 3D core (based on JMonkeyEngine) with optional grass, water reflection, billboarded trees, fog state, bloom effect, shader based wind animation etc. that can load .obj and .3ds models.
- UI widgets & detailed map system (partially)
- Water system
- Wildlife engine
- Economy, populations (partially)
- Strong skill system (partially)

How to check out latest SVN development code and how to run it?
---------------------------------------------------------------

SVN is for subversion - a concurrent versions system for developers. 
If you want to check it, you should have sun java + svn tool from 
subversion's homepage installed, plus java ant toolkit to compile it. 
If you have these installed type

# svn co https://javacrpg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/javacrpg javacrpg

After go to root dir, and type 'ant'. It should compile and start it.
