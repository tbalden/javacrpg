Installing and Running JCRPG
-----------------------------

A draft description here, a better one can be found at wiki ( http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/javacrpg/index.php?title=Download )

First, install Sun JRE 1.5 or later on your PC. (use your distribution's repository or download at http://java.sun.com)
Optionally you can use OpenJDK 6+ (available under different Linux distributions like Ubuntu).
Then download jcrpg from http://sf.net/projects/javacrpg downloads. Unpack, and run jcrpg executable.

Under Linux use 
# chmod +x jcrpg.sh 
to set it executable.

Requirements:

- Around 500MB free RAM with default config
- Opengl accelerated videocard
- X11 or Windows or MacOS
- Sound card

Use Option menu to change performance / details related settings.
If you're running an Intel vga (linux) and have problems with running the game (textures missing), edit your config.properties and add/set DISABLE_DDS=true.

If having troubles with starting the game on a non-standard resolution display (meta-desktop) try switch off multiple desktops.
Switching off desktop effects on low-end hardware may help performance of the game.

Read README for further details.
