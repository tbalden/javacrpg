Installing and Running JCRPG


First, install Sun JRE 1.5 or later on your PC.
Then download jcrpg. Unpack, and run jcrpg executable.
Configure config.properties if you experience low FPS. (Set low RENDER_DISTANCE, RENDER_GRASS_DISTANCE.)

Requirements:

- Around 200-300MB free RAM
- Opengl accelerated videocard
- X11 or Windows or MacOS

Configure RENDER_DISTANCE and VIEW_DISTANCE if want to lower memory requirement or run out of memory. :-)
