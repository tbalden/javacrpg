[ ] dungeon dev
	[ ] slow, too much details
	[ ] ground is varying??
	
	[ ] positioning of dungeon in Z direction must be wrong!! or check of water is done with wrong center coordinate!!
		( AbstractInfrastructure I modified to reposition blockstartX/Z, but this conflicts with water detection)

[X] add town misc objects, new plaza ground type?
	[-] needs a development of some kind of AbstractInfrastructure abstract method? some kind of 
		decision where to put what kind of things...probably the Economic/Ground should be aware of it??
		[X]!!! type's likeness of distance from center?? good!
		or !!! grouped by some typeId together into some blocks in a block?
	[ ] integrate tidbit's bench to where ??

[ ] the other misc objects
[ ] cyclops

[ ] render scene full screen UI quad while rendering. to hide buildup phase of scene

[-] 2D sprite billboard monsters for classic revival and in lack of 3d artists!
	or Review other open media project's 3d models

BUGS:
####

[ ] throwing knife bug - doesnt show and slow --> couldn't reproduce yet

[?] bug reported by brian - combat bug:
	[ ] added more log, should recheck if happens again

[-] moving units not appearing over the other side of the world!!!??? - > coordinate calc is wrong I suppose
	- not valid with battle scenario now
[X] billboard badly positioned for gorilla
[X] camera is not good positioned for kobold - above them etc.
[X] walking around the world at the other pole throws...:

-----------------------

[ ] particle effect for models
[?] camera bigger view - switch off back rendered models (check cave)

qubodup: timong: I recommend the Baldur's gate way, where you select class first -> select profession and then
	attributes set??


[ ] cursed weapons - how can they stick upon use?

[ ] check wciow updates on glestanimals - animated ? 

[ ] natural Talent addProfessionWithFilter for EntityDescription - to filter out some spell forms a monster
	doesnt have.

sanity point for Morale is like mana for hp, limiting social skills!

[-] try using md5importer - animation problems are unsolvable -> too slow

[ ] recovery saves for combat phase - on crash useful -> saving gameState in combat somehow.

[ ] keyboard configuration for movement - French keyboards etc cant use 'wsad'


## list before next release:


	[ ] use & cast in normal mode too
	
	[ ] reorder party window in turn act phase window
	
	[ ] replace the whole ecology generation from XML with class based parameters
	
	[X] test Single NPC encounter's post encounter window - unit not showing??
		
	
	
	[ ] Encounter grounds mode
		
	        [ ] camera for lower creatures is not so good, also normal creatures description texture cannot be seen
		[ ] Inventory window - set a filtering to Wapons -> multiselecting weapons and set a filter Off/On button
			-- in combat mode too. only filtered objects will appear as choice in TurnActWindow
			
		[ ] WALK unit advance - moving around - tricky positioning/ A* movement??
		[ ] NEUTRALIZED anim type use in EncLogic, turning model backwards in j3dmoving
		[ ] neutralization should make relation better
		    killing should make it worse with the group
		[ ] different HUD for encounter mode!
		[ ] protection form Good Evil? addition of alignment against physical combat form damages??
		[X] a bigger 'Encounter' UI element popup when loading an encounter...
			[ ]light effect -> pull down lights, and then pull up on encounter grounds
	
		[ ] more SKILLS
			[ ] fabrication of ammunition and such - fletcher, work Skill
			[ ] thief helper skill, disarm?
	
		[ ] too quick anim at startup
		[ ] flickering anim change...	
		[X] turn camera on actor
			[ ] real turn -> move it in background simpleUpdate?
	
		[ ] clear out center of battle ground - modify height variation as a Constructor parameter for plain
			- fix the seed for these generations somehow... now HashUtil's seed if changed battle ground may be bad!
			
		[ ] economics too!
	
		[ ] skill act form choice AI more complex -> choose different skills, and use positive forms too on friendly units.
			[ ] AI use of potions/objects too!
		
		[ ] enemy unit effect icons too
			[ ] Confuse effect -> EvaluatorBase or EncounterLogic should mix up attacked units
			
		[ ] summoning spells
		
	
	[ ] leveling of group (not fragment -> it can be joined etc., don't  persist such things in fragment!)
		overall organization level should be increased -> organization level means tougher units on generation
		 	some kind of randomization!
		[ ] elaborate GeneratedMemberInstance leveling - attributes/skills and profession, skill act forms
	
	[ ] world generation - 
		concentrate friendly groups - don't let enemies close at start,
		tweak relation values against player? aggressivity should manipulate first sight relation to negative?
	
	[ ] more sounds
	[ ] better portraits
	[ ] 2d item arts

	[ ] walk anim for Mage
	
	[ ] aggressivity factor for default relationship
	
	[ ] gold system


	[ ] town center infrastrucre?? - EntityFragment populatePopulation helping?

	[ ] boarmen are not attacking sometime ??

	[ ] MORE SKILLS: spell forms, 
		[X] social effects, neutralizing morale, 
		[ ] protecting Mental sanity 
		[ ] protection spells, boost spells with effects
		[X] social helper skills - > Strategy

	[ ] texture state cacheing into md5reader2?
	
	[ ] climate level system?
	[ ] city walls? around whole districts if it's enough advanced!!
	
	[ ] add labirynth monster Population?? ;)
		[ ] add undead castle population?? ;)
	
	[ ] add treasure chests
	
	[ ] COSAT slope:
	 lower height point geo tile override height ->
		and water tile + in getWaterCube

	[ ] shadows coloring wrong color, white???
	[ ] solve rerender problems - remaining units there, wrongly positioned etc.
	
	[ ] farview -> four big heightmaps - with height only
		- slightly lower generated than normal ground.

	[-] try AnimatedModelNode with neakor's importer ---  seems slower
		-> shared node??
		
	-- QA/DOC

	[ ] documenting points, attr - (how it works related to points), calculations, leveling
		[ ] documenting skill act forms (later completed)

##


[X] use PlacementMatrix matrix to place scenario 
	[ ](colored OSD for different lines)...

	[ ] when the Turn Act begins, (after the encounter phase) all should be decided which side the given
	entities will take part: enemy or friend - neutral should be removed.
	Friendly units should be placed on left and right (also in ordered lines, so nearer can fight the front of the
	enemy) - like a plus to the own units, facing face-2-face the
	enemy. Enemy units should be placed in front (the nearer can attack directly, others shooting and magic!).
	An ordered placement list should be generated before starting the encounter for friendly units (1 to 3 lines)
	and in front of this an enemy ordere placement list (1 to 3 lines), after that should be placed the
	3d models and start the round. Movement -> how to animate? 
	
	each turn Neutralized (mentally or physically)  friendly/enemy units should be removed from the act -
	after that if someone is detained by player -> prison?payment for it for the player?
	
	A fight if won by neutralization should positively add to a relationship
	
[ ] try md5reader2 dot3 bump shader 

[X] more groups and single-type groups instead of one big groups with multi-types -> encounter phase view needs that
	[X] encounter 3d models -> one model should represent a group!!

[X] model viewer for md5, separate application

[X] owned infrastrucures are present now in a build of a population, and it is set as owned economic too...
 now 
	[ ] add "at home" state for PersistentEntities -> they should be found in one of their infrastructure, roaming boundary set to its position!


[ ] turnAct, encounter phase EncounterLogic - big development needed, plus 3D view + J3DMovingEngine combination...

    [ ] skill system: skill act forms for all skills, skill act form parameters!
    further skill design, how it will work!

[ ] entity ->
	[X]
		! Multiple RoamingBoundaries ! -> added a size parameter, an EntityInstance can be fragmented
		to do different things around, and can rejoin, RoamingBoundaries removed for that Fragment.
		
	[ ] implement split and rejoin! 
	
		If a group's fragment's size is lessening, it will be counted in its own fragment RoamingBoundaries
		till it rejoins group. -> this way we have little memory overhead for subgroups (and REMOVE the subEntities
		thing from EntityInstance). EntityMemberInstances (NPCs) can decide which fragment to follow.
		
	- Entities in alliances with other entities -> like in a town, commoners with fighters, nobles etc.
	(similar to Population -> Town integration)
		
[ ] Limiting access to "Population" and closed areas. The presence of an "overlapping boundary" (encounter) 
	does only count if a population zone's owner doesn't detect access (skill)/ it gives permission / 
	is friendly. Entities inside
	a Population won't meet a roaming unit until the population has power to defend the area. Entities inside
	can nominate defenders? 
	- Always register CurrentGeography in RoamingBoundaries of its fragment groups of an EntityInstance.
	- Checks -> upon a roaming boundary overlap of two entities Geography/ EConomics should be checked
	if they have a "defend" position. 
	This should be a new rule surely implemented to avoid encounters that are blocked by walls/economic or
	inaccessible areas.

[ ] inter-entity relations web

	[ ] add goals to groups / members based on entity relation qualities + automatically generated
		goals (colonization etc.), to make drive for different actions for groups.
	[ ] add some actions / outcomes that take place in encounters between groups and modifies relations
	
	[ ] generation -> add some conflicts, knowledge of other group's places etc. and goals
	
	--> this will lead to design encounter mode of player too 

	
[X] encounter screens, Interception, Encounter TurnAction windows


	[?] // TODO based on economic (house) heights add steps to the population
	
[X] TreeLocator.java
	[ ] //TODO this is not working correctly for a few cases, why?replaced with +1 for now

[X] skill based hud EntityOMeter
	[ ] -> only detected beings should be displayed

[ ] cave geo population -> rock rooms?


[ ] try to set fixed framerate


 [?] a giant 3d bitmap for explored area to make a local map charting work 

[ ] Skill tuner page with subframes - selecting a group of skills makes changing to those skill tuners - just like in Wiz7

[ ] social skills -> in a combat these people can throw their different skills into combat -> fighting other social skills
of the enemy or friend. We'll have to develop different 'words' for the different skills to make it really funny, and make 
a peaceful solution available in most of the cases.

[ ] possible portraits? http://search.freegamedev.net/artitems/tag/campaigns

[ ] rocks to mountain side with new RenderedHashGeneratedSides probably...


[?] gorilla model scaling -> walk in the air :-) recenter in blender?? -> fixed temp for gor only probably.

[ ] Combat !!!! 
	combat encounter -> regroup friendly units left/right flank of player!! :-) Enemies remain opposite of player. --- make possible to look around while combat! ;-)

[ ] ecology
    [ ] sophisticated generation -> geography, water food etc...
    [ ] foodchain - generation and per turn eat, plus multiplication etc.
    [ ] turn choice of AI, skills involved etc.
    [ ] moving of groups, fixed groups
  	[ ] hierarchy -> dynamic, boundaries added together, processed to the top of the hierarchy -> events possible on every level of living example: country <-> city population <-> guards etc.
	[ ] entering domain in a given turn will trigger possibilities for you to start skill based processes -> trying to hunt down animals in the domain, or avoiding a group of bandits there
	[ ] foodchain based generation, growing/decay, multiplication, new groups later ...
    
[ ] encounter system
    [ ] encounter choices, skills etc, UI elements
    [ ] combat - grouped, decisions etc., attribute + skill to lists

Groups:
	Dune/Wizardry like depersonalized groups moving around! Special NPC and such likely as part of groups.
	Hash sorted coordinates in a domain. Create moving cursors for humanoid communication. 
	Decisions made by player affect back through the group if depersonalized is subject.

[ ] encountered group -> actions done with them spread by turn basis in the whole group around. so in a few turns the whole big entityInstance group can become hostile or friendly

each entity will look for the groups nearby every turn. Even if the nearby entity have acted on it a new acting from itself is needed in every case.
The unit shall check if there is common intersection with more than one nearby entity and do a common act upon them in one act not two. In this
case it can use as much entity of it as the sum of the common radius would allow!! 
If they don't intersect do two separate act for each other nearby entity.


EntityGroups won't do sophisticated positioning when acting between themselves -> only ActionPoint based thing should be implemented. 

With player : PositionCalculus is used and extended for different Entities.

UI:
--
[ ] combat thingies...
[X] player choice window -> actions when meeting entities
[ ] UI detailed map

Moving:
------
[ ] j3dmovingengine
    http://jsourcery.com/api/captiveimagination.com/jmonkeyengine/02-05-2007/jmetest/renderer/TestMipMaps.source.html -> animated model
	[X] wildlife -> rangedBoundaries
	
	[ ] refactor of loadObjects in model loader , extend AnimatedModelNode with additional object nodes like weapon etc... 


World Generator:
---------------
[-] World generator
	parameterized cool world generation!
	
	[X] Geography GenerationProperty -> what to put on and what not, where to begin where not. Use implementation independent type references for FLOW_BEGIN, FLOW_END etc...
		[ ] sophisticate
		
	[X] rivers depending on oceans! ;-)
		
		[ ] ! River: if no river on two sides endside should be SIDE_NONE!!
			[ ] River end is too rocky in the sea?? check outside water (like geo getoutsideheightpoint, getOutsideWaterPoint)
		
	[ ] mountain bigger than blocks, trickier mountain algorithm. ?
	[ ] valley?
	[ ] lake
	
	[ ] creating "Territories/Areas" of geography -> bigger multiblock areas with DistanceBasedBoundaries! In generation process this can be done
	
	[ ] hash based geo placing through a map (like static HashMap), if two geo block is similar, join them into one geo (?)
	

Other:
-----


[ ] moving N-S should be limited on map edge!  
[?] movement in 8 direction! new blocker side type -> trees can be moved in between, walls cannot?


[ ] climate
	[ ] swamp , savana climate belt
	[ ] climate levels: SNOW limit to the mountains
	[ ] climate related events -> snowing, rain, UI messages
	[ ] seasonal models for plants
	[ ] detailed fruit object structure later and such!


[ ] Knowledge base Modularity -> things can have knowledge attached to it, which modifies the possibilities of players to handle them:
	plug knowledge about object/monsters/animals etc with the given
	object/being! Thus you can collect bonus info about them random
	scattered around the world, -- beat monsters more easy etc.

[ ] lamp key, to switch on/off lamp in the dark!
	[ ] spot light to the user in the night, doesnt work!!


[ ] occluder invisible quad to the tree middle top -> billboard it but in 90 to the camera so you cannot see it, but occluding! :-)
[ ] bumpmapped texture disappear in the night! ?? checkout jme source?
		

[ ] clean up climate and implement all parts of it with conditions, continue the work on it
[ ]	implement changing 3d models, how (updating some of the rendered nodes)? 
[ ] rain, fog, snow?

[ ] mineral system too to the caves etc.

[ ] skySphere change: night sky based on calculated light value (v)
[ ] cloud planes on sky

[ ] add Harek's table to the house


[?] quicken loading of Cubes in Geography etc. 
[?] Lod modelling trees with billboard images captured in blender!

[X] Test with Scene Monitor 1.0
    http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/jmeforum/index.php?topic=8159.msg64486#msg64486
    http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/jmeforum/index.php?topic=8159.msg65768#msg65768
    * To begin, add the 'scenemonitor.jar' to your project or classpath. 
    * If you want text descriptions add the 'sm_textdescriptor_jme2.jar'. If you want editable properties add 'sm_properties_jme2.jar'.
    * To tool can be displayed or hidden using the SceneMonitor.getMonitor().showViewer(); function. I would suggest adding a key binding to show or hide the tool during execution.

OPTIMIZATIONS:
#############
[?]also some check is needed for water present or not in rendered area
	and if not render pass should be disabled


[X] to check for OS leak/Java mem state info: Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory()

(02:45:54 PM) Pali: but md5reader2 is using jme's animation api
(02:46:00 PM) Momoko_Fan: its not

[-] check mesh.xml loading in radakan, convert to jme2.0?

[X] DDS for GUI, check how it's going in memory/ 
	[?] font cache??? Reduce mem from 200m

[?] md2 model for animated?

[X] water reflection not for grass batches! (one by one addition of spatials to WaterRenderPass)

[-] md5reader -? buffer pool? how is it cached , java 6 is correct

[X] texture splattering doesn't work with new atlas??

[X] shadows don't work for moving units!
	jme2 -> noTexture comment out caused it...

[-] reconsider texture splattering - use of static textures instead?

[X] remove shadow render pass / 'water reflection for all nodes' if in the night!

[X] jme2 migr:
	[X] add jcrpg logo for choice (BaseGame Settings prop file??)
	[X] check light source things?? not correct for animated
		[X] check a day/night cycle

	[X] add fps stats
	[X] add choice of screen res
	
[X] bug with texture state vegetation terrain level conflict...wrongly positioned height. review that code (renderNodes + VegetationSetup)

[X] reorganize RenderedArea. world.getCube part into ->
		getFilledZones (returns Y min/max intervals where getCube should be called, filtering out empty zones!)
	[X] TEST!

!!! [-] deadlock while walking too quick ?! test with slowing the process probably

[X] strange vertexes to tree foliage because of the bigBatching!! It's not caused by Pooling, tried without it, and same result!!
	It was the modified locTrans vector of the Trimesh, it shouldn't be used in instantiating the GeometryBatchInstance!

[X] culling problem with some foliage?? probably it has no proper boundingbox?? (single element batch?) - it was instance.buildMatrices needed! 

[-] rendering bug - behind player battle ground doesnt show tiles... ??
	Maybe angle is not set correctly upon reinit?
!! [X] economy update wrongly leftovers from previous geography CUBES and level!!!

!!!	[X]Economy updadte rerender doubles the number of buffers, not handed back of the geotiles! REVIEW THIS ALL!

[X] when in middle of the VIEW -> RENDER DISTANCE border, start a background process of loading for the given 
	coordinates -> j3dstandingE.renderCubes and RenderCubes X Y Z must be refactored to calculate
	the render position based on load-finish's relative position and stored worldX/Y/Z coords. 
	[X] not perfect - some elements get lost with removal?? or not rendered on time?? (colliding locks?)
	[X] hsRenderedNodes - NullPointerException
		it's using a rerendered/removed one???
		java.lang.NullPointerException
		- concurrency problesm eleminated (use of safety copy)

[X] use a separate hsCurrentCubes for the rendering and overwrite on completion in the MAIN thread!
    Fix relativePosition storing for renderNodes, use that one instead of getting it from unsafe changing source!
	[-] thorough testing!! especially with rerender/thread render at the same time problems!!
	[X] tiles are not showing sometimes!!?? not loaded on time??
			-> new RenderedArea is buggy , not loading some parts or removing them??
		
	[?] normals get messed up on freshly loaded parts -> Don't add ground tiles  where no neighbor data
		is present? or force loading directly from world??
	
	[X] optimize new rendering.. too much removal???


[X] unbuffered TiledTerrainBlock - on the fly returning newly set buffers for geomBatchMesh? is it quick enough?
		it will save memory!

[X] REMOVE first, releasing unneeded - cave parts can eat new buffers!!

[?] something still eating memory? test sounds!! (playLoading eats it?) switch off audio and measure
	?? it's buffered by OpenALSystem... so it's not gonna eat all on the long run probably.
	[-] cube/rendered area cache?? checked JProfiler
	[X] map textures again???

[X] separate config of bloom and DoF

[-] test buffer pooling under windows java, it's glitchy under windows... ITS VBO problem with new buffer pooling
	
	[X] make caching of font quads to shared mesh cache??

[X] full rerender still eating up new cache partially!

[-] rendering shows strange elements... missing textures

[X] use DDS!!
	[X] convert more, use FLIP in modelLoader, reconvert flipped
(09:42:08 PM) Momoko_Fan: download Compressonator
(09:42:14 PM) Momoko_Fan: from ATI site
(09:42:48 PM) Momoko_Fan: go to batch convert, specify DDS format, for mipmap generation, use Box filter, for compression, use DirectX compression DXT1 or DXT1A

Using Gimp DDS -> tweak mipmap.c , add 2 more mipmaps, for 2:1 even 3! Flip vertically image.
For alpha textures use DXT5 instead of DXT1. Box filter
[X] make textures for continental (normal 3 tree) + continental mountain (2 pines)
	
!!! [-] TEST QuickOrderedList times -> remove/add an arraylist may be time consuming with a long list!!!

[-] adding a new thread for some of the things?

[X] test VBO with new buffer pool...what's the problem with it?

[X] reconsider geometry batch - reuse them, how? buffers cannot be resized ??!?!
	look into snylts geom batch. add/remove how it works?
	
	[X] BufferPool solution for GeomBatch ->> Update not appearing parts??!! indices were the bad
		[X] -> faster cache lookup - how? make performance logs for pools!


!!!! [X] GeoTileLoading exact buffer cache is wrong - some of the geotile TerrainBlocks are not
		even used in a batch so they cannot be removed from cache either! invisible elements are reused
		with the new mesh old mesh is not handed back!!!

		
		!!! [X] GeoTileLoader shouldnt create always new TerrainBlocks with new Buffers!!! a local cache
		upon release (cache instance meshes in GeomBatch and reuse upon release!?
			[X] test this, make it more for other models too, review whole loading code
		[X] better cache chunk sizes? bigger? less creation/lookup time  
	[X] cache is wrong, not reused???just growing
	

	 
 

[X] hunt down memory usage !!! -> createTextureStates?? NOT --> it's the GeometryBatch probably!
	300 MB at start, around 500MB without any batches, and ~800MB+ with batches / loading models
	ITS the buffers..pooling it + geotileloader / batch refactor with instance mesh can solve it ->
		cache it too
		
		[X]

!!!!    [X] shadow pass AFTER water reflection!


[-] fog fragment shader distance based!? (bigger batches is a problem)
	[-] it doesnt want to work!! GLSL Fragment Shader??

    !!!! [X] grassRootNode -> leave out it from reflection
    [X] fix water reflection? wrong camera position set?
    
!! [X] more texture types for one tree, random/foliage quad!
	-> texture coordinates swap for more random look on trees?
	
[X]CHECK what's this varying world cache size??? once 60k then 240k???

[X] Atlas Texture to vegetation -> to TEXTURESTATEVEGETATION add a special description kind

[X] Atlas Texture to tree foliage


[-] add renderToViewport to movement code in segments??
	or add updateDisplay to renderViewPort?
 	

[-] grass disappears!! -> wrong dist calc.

[X] distance based scarcity to trimesh geom batch instances? FOG shader distance based?? bigger batches possible

[X] fix economy update billboard prob. 

[X] add a UI render pass to render over the 3d part...
[X] DoF perfection...

	
	--
	[X] add choice for DETAILS settings at startup???
		- different starter batch files - jcrpg with args param
	
	[X] add sample configs,party characters
	

	[X] cave InternalLight missing??
	[X] encounter ground bug Render not complete if you don't move in normal mode at starting a game

	[X] render bug when not moving away from start point!! also switchin back some parts are missing! locking/updating is wrong
		IT MUST BE LOCKING, if Locking is set to false in GeomHelper, partially it renders...

	[X] camera is not working good for 2nd line!! - 3 steps in the village you can test it with 5 groups boar

	[X] redesign jungle tree
		[X] palm by Zphr
		
	[X] billboard part veg -> simple model batch for trunk!!
	
	[X] normal problems - rendered area edges

	[X] reconsider continental too ?? curved tree? more texture vegetation!! flower bush!!
	[X] reexport models of house by Zphr

	[X] add continuous sound sources like water - renderToViewPort should collect them by cube basis -
		hashset - play them continuously
		
		[X] fix not cutting out if you don't see a node
		[X] add more sounds -> grass etc.
		[X] snow sound didn't work 
		[X] continuous town sounds
		
	[X] water reflection level??
	[X] is the continental grass still okay??? all kind of continental grass is there?

	[X] stitching problem mountain!
		some kind of /calcRelative pos/ problem!!! sizes wrong??

	[+] add back Float to pointHeight!! use it for corners height calc, more random thing it will be!
		[X] add some detailed functions for forest/plain too

	[X] make a better model for under cave entrance -> rock under a separate type now!
		what it should look alike?

	[X] cave entrance height ?? - CAVE should override pointheight at entrance by +1 !!
		[X] use new models
			[X] under entrance block
			
			[X] behind entrance double entrance replacement?? - doesn't work yet, check Cave code
				REFACTOR the whole code with some better entrance part and better cube sides that
				hide the mountain at entrance too
				
			[X] solve that cave only begins after a while inside the mountain
			
	[X] continental problem with encouter ground in city

	[X] water edge at economic's overwrite looks really bad
	
			[X] water edge at house is bad too
			[X] wooden ground + normal ground edge with water gap again....
			
	[X] use OR remove HEIGHT override arrays - removal is good - not creating arrays unnecessarily 

	[X] use new rotationAndLocate for HashRotatedSide, reexport bushes -> when rendering to viewport
		check geo tile corners of the cube and calculate a new height elevation!		


	[X] Check Zphr's new house model tiles!!
		[X] add grounds, steps
		[X] add new house 
	
	[-] add some 'randmoness' in gimp to edges of alpha mask
	
	[X] camera positioning -> override middle height if it's specified by the cube
	
	[X] add a non-flora grass only ground to the encounters - if no ecoground present
		- fix eco-ground of town overridden by grass??
		EncounterGround extends 

	
	[-] rewrite the whole geo -> tile thing to a heighmap based alpha splatted TerrainBlock thing!
		- loading should get through the geographies of zones, getting all the surface height
		and genTile types (texture types). It should then generate an alphamask for a texture splatting.
		Each texture type should have an own alphamask generated.
		??? - you will need a good image creator for that
		
	

	[X] find a good solution for terrain transition --> use GLSL shader of momokofan??
		http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/jmeforum/index.php?topic=6870.0
		
		[X] fix edges color not fitting WHY?? - maybe alpha texture is wrong, try with original,
			try with non-gimp PNG

		[X] make caching work for them
		[X] add extra texture names in SimpleModel for different height ratios,
				add simpleModel function to get Height based texture name or default one
				-> blending based on steepness - rocky side.
				
				Use SimpleModel.getId(place) to generate different cache key for that
				and add a getTexture(place) - use cornerheights
		[X] edges are not blended correctly! - maybe caching problem!

	[X] achieve that Economic ground Pavement too have ground below it!! check how it looks like!
		maybe override can then be removed for economics ->
		[X] add new pavement by Zphr, with logs below it

	[X] refactor grass vegetation level generation
		[-] it should be done by picking level from Ground block ?? ordered rendering in renderToViewPort
			--> done by using cornerheights data in GeometryBatchHelper 
		
	[X] setting normals on surface of thing -> pseudo joining from neighbors
			- override TerrainBlock - buildNormals -> use Cube data transformed instead of vertex height data
			-> TiledTerrainBlock -> a plus heightmap row/col added by the RenderedArea's cached cubes cornerheight data
	
	[X] some bad walking near the cave entrance at the mountains side - it was invis. ROCK needed
	

	[X] refactor:
			Override corner height averaging for Economics, and who wants it overridden -> it
				has to be done

	[X] ##refactor GROUND rendering -> define internal fragment levels for point height calc! which can 
		modify the ground types -> Return a new Ground Cube type parametered for special model loading -
		the special model loading should use TerrainBlock with random parameters and the internal level
		--! getPointHeightDetailedMatrix !! it will return a 4x4 map of height for each corner of the tile side

[X] particles, projectiles, boosting up spell tomes
[X] lock bug -> player can move in enc

[X] j3dmoving engine -> animation should be ended on time and regulated

	the event is finished for the step in 3d or it can wait more before moving to next encounter plan step.
	 (Interrupt possible later?) 


[-] EntityInstance -> group size - dying group members? how to count it in the instance's group data??
	----> don't count data, only in a turn act/encounter
	Randomizing should help that you won't meet so often groups that its too much overwhelming the number
	of encounters because of no 'positioned groups and group sizes'. So recalculated group sizes,
	and make it more random that the intersection meets who and how much! 
	
[o] initiating, collecting acts of members, and playing the plan in EncounterLogic

[X] inventory, character data sheet windows (F2,F3)
    [X] perfection!



[X] groups trespassed - icons - UI - EntityOMeter

[X] Population.java

	[X] population change -> how to modify renderedArea
		--> population updates happen in a cycle of X turns. Then a reload is done, clearing rendered
		area cache too

	[X] new idea -> population should be shared by different groups. groups can join a population migrating(?)
		Populations should be in center of fix sized "areas", no overlapping this way guaranteed, also
		if a population is over a size, it should migrate to another area, splitting up the group to
		[ ] a "settler" and remaining group. Looking for home :)

	[X] make it better with big gaps (non 1)
	[-] no inside farview from outside! and vica versa?
	[X] don't load twice as much when farview...more terrain loaded, farview distance param? 

[-] bounding box oct tree cull -> render much bigger parts? non-always-culling part - subpart of view distance -> if something out of it -> always cull

[X] ecology groups should generate economy (houses, lairs) in their home place
	[X] !!! sophisticate it to big sized communities, quicken loading -> arrays of houses instead of one house/group -> residential areas fully with algorithm
	[X] geography heights should be overridden!? it's all wrong now under the houses.
[X] setting groupingrule sizes makes the group give encounter sizes of 0 always!! change the calc method... (check gorillaHorde commented part)
	

[X] living things foundations -

[X] ui element encounter predisplay -> icons representing the lifeform, ? icon if you cannot identify it/don't know it yet.

[X] mountain geography population -> geography pointheight should be averaged at the given area where the house is located.
    [-] -> logs for mountain huts with ladders instead of height modification

[X] camera rotating with turning to the back of the given cube reverse the faced direction, so trees and such can
	be seen.

[-]	replace model geom batch with a HeightMap -> addItem will set the height levels of a big Terrain, texture splatting??


[X] MEM EATER!! What's eating memory????

	[X] local map fixed
	[X] world map shouldn't be updating a full position image now, only repositioning a sign image quad!!
		[X] replace all with ImageGraphics - different imagegraphics transparents

[-] seemless movement -> batch add/remove takes too much time of the render


[X] light of the skysphere goes wrong with walking one direction a lot! lightnode or sg?

[X] Cave -> 1 sized wrong at some places
	[X] no internal flora is appearing!!
	[X] no entrance where you can't enter -> isCaveEmpty() hash

[X] plants inside -> color is wrongly set to outside quad color
	-> this will need some further work as models are pooled and also batched

[X] with inside flora cave limiter walls is not working (maybe OUTSIDE cube is detected because of the flora cube??)

[-] UI

[X]  MODEL POOL BASED ON VIEW DISTANCE, NOT ON RENDER DISTANCE!! (less memory)
	use with pseoudo nodes!! that are only placed on the scenario to be replaced with real PoolNodes from

[X] jungle bush
[X] reinvent renderArea, magnifications?? need distant view too
[X] optimize j3dcore render/renderside (based on profile.txt) to make
