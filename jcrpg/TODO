[ ] transparent texture finally working! Put some on the trees, collect some in your next journey to the wild ;)
[ ] use LODModels!
[ ] Test ImposterModel on FBO system

[ ] Wildlife should be generated based on Flora percentage given by flora generators??
	[ ] Wildlife -> animal kingdom with a chain of predating, complex fauna interaction rethinking

[ ] ? Strip green from trees, create new Model type, SimpleTreeModel. Would define texture spatial type, plane.
	alpha state, texture etc.


[X] LODModel -> distanceSwitchedNode -> jungle, increase FPS with less detailed models
[X] ImposterNode http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=imposternode - lowest detail - rendered
[X] Billboard http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=billboardnode&s=billboard
	

[X] lens flare!
[X] orbiter Suns/Moons each should have own Light direction (see j3dCore for more details on TODO)


[X] Time in engine -> skybox..

[X] jungle middle flora -> leaves, desert cactus model :)
[X] fall down where no GroundSubType! to steep for example!!
[X] Hill_steep.3ds is wrongly rotated! After that fix Mountain.java to user correct SIDES[] for steeps of diff. 
	directions. Then complete Movement Blocking in j3dcore for Climbing.
	
[X] Weather engine - implement Climate -> fauna - climate condition based forest/plain!
	[ ] Change flag for rendered thing!? -> example: climate change callback for already generated parts?


[X] mountain -> steep display all around a new ground level - movement up ahead on it!! + unpassable rockside generation
[X] bug in Globe mode -> houses dont display going round ?
[X] Rendered continuous side bug!

[X] Magnification of Area implementation -> Place will define its magnification RATIO which is used to determine subplaces exact coordinates in a
	far more bigger area to move in!

[ ] world -> ai, place, object, faune, flora

[X] InputHandler -> create classic keyboard movement/turning which calls J3DCore render area renewal too
