[ ] cave into the mountain!
	[ ] settable empty space for entrance cave -> not only one cube at the edge!
	[ ] settable level highness, levels that belong together, share the same block/empty pattern
	[ ] implement surface interface!
	[ ] optimization -> if in cave, display only cave cubes, and some distance of other cubes?
	[X] cave lighting
	[ ] use hash rotated side
	[ ] flare is visible through the caves! intRootNode to a common parent with extRootNode

[ ] lamp key, to switch on/off lamp in the dark!
	[ ] spot light to the user in the night, doesnt work!!

[ ] mountain steep walk bug to one direction walk
[ ] quicken loading of Cubes in Geography etc. 
[ ] far view optimizatios for trees? display less tree in the far?
[ ] far view replacement of cubes with sg else to look better...a grey plane?
 
[ ] wall can be seen inside because of camera point of view too close -> restructure walls to the middle of the node??

[ ] cherry foliage

[ ] occluder invisible quad to the tree middle top -> billboard it but in 90 to the camera so you cannot see it, but occluding! :-)
[ ] narrowing quad sized bb part models for pine?
[ ] bumpmapped texture disappear in the night! ?? checkout jme source?
		
[ ] add Harek's table to the house

[ ] clean up climate and implement all parts of it with conditions, continue the work on it
[ ]	implement changing 3d models, how (updating some of the rendered nodes)? 
[ ] rain, fog, snow?


[ ] skySphere change: night sky based on calculated light value (v)
[ ] cloud planes on sky


[ ] Wildlife should be generated based on Flora percentage given by flora generators??
	[ ] Wildlife -> animal kingdom with a chain of predating, complex fauna interaction rethinking

[?] Lod modelling trees with billboard images captured in blender!
[?] Tree generation in java code? (billboard leaf quads!)
[?] Write the wind vertex program? Now it's cpu based!
[?] lens flare too intensive with bloom -> check what's to be done - no way to improve yet :-/

--
[X] looking left / right like up / down
[X] clean up files in SVN
[X] user manual update
[-] if no grass, don't put it on node!
[-] separate thread for render
[X] differentiate angle of renderToViewPort for turning and for normal view mode (parameterized) -> less models
[X] push models back to pool and use Placeholder based on turn / view direction!!
	[X] turning is not right yet
[X] culling problem with reused nodes!!!

[X] tree normal vectors, too blocky trees! try with exported obj models!
	[X] too dark trees now! -> mtl file firs 3 values "Ka" set to 0.500000 !


[X] new pooling -> update shadow occluder activation!!

[X] model pool ageing and clearing later
[X] model pool perfection -> some nodes doesn't display after render!! quad vegetation displays on steeps!!

[X]  MODEL POOL BASED ON VIEW DISTANCE, NOT ON RENDER DISTANCE!! (less memory)
	use with pseoudo nodes!! that are only placed on the scenario to be replaced with real PoolNodes from
		Model pool! The pool will load a node if necessary! renderToViewPort will use the ModelPool, not the
		render part!

[X] jungle big tree - covering all, greens on it?
[X] jungle bush
[X] reinvent renderArea, magnifications?? need distant view too
[X] optimize j3dcore render/renderside (based on profile.txt) to make 
	usable on 15+ DISTANCE with moving too! (3d part is okay now with 6200go)
[-] memory eater -> quadbillboard is not fine enough...eats memory, caching it solved!
[X] Shadow occluder number too much -> hashSet, get distance on every render/ remove add them
[X] update LWJGL/JME from repository
[X] BillboardPartModel with more quads for Lowest detail, math for more quads, 
	add LOD level 3 for single quad
[-] nicer low detail textures for acacia png -> replaced with original texture
[X] billboard ngplant trees, hashmap based, BillboardPartsModel
[X] billboarding the grass! (rotation didnt help! :/)
[X] shadow render pass added! :-)
[-] Naive vegetation development? -> billboarding?? - Quad in other apps too!
[X] darkening veg -> mesh? or what?

[X] redraw Window model, it's too detailed on the lower part, unnecessarily
[X] grass kinds, sophisticated FloraSetup things!
[X] steeper mountain side is buggy with corners!!!

[X] CKeyAction camera settings, bad when looking up/down!

[X] finalize trees, create low level flora
[-] Test ImposterModel on FBO system
[-] ? Strip green from trees, create new Model type, SimpleTreeModel. Would define texture spatial type, plane.
	alpha state, texture etc.

[X] transparent texture finally working! Put some on the trees, collect some in your next journey to the wild ;)
[X] use LODModels!

[X] LODModel -> distanceSwitchedNode -> jungle, increase FPS with less detailed models
[X] ImposterNode http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=imposternode - lowest detail - rendered
[X] Billboard http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=billboardnode&s=billboard
	

[X] lens flare!
[X] orbiter Suns/Moons each should have own Light direction (see j3dCore for more details on TODO)


[X] Time in engine -> skybox..

[X] jungle middle flora -> leaves, desert cactus model :)
[X] fall down where no GroundSubType! to steep for example!!
[X] Hill_steep.3ds is wrongly rotated! After that fix Mountain.java to user correct SIDES[] for steeps of diff. 
	directions. Then complete Movement Blocking in j3dcore for Climbing.
	
[X] Weather engine - implement Climate -> fauna - climate condition based forest/plain!
	[ ] Change flag for rendered thing!? -> example: climate change callback for already generated parts?


[X] mountain -> steep display all around a new ground level - movement up ahead on it!! + unpassable rockside generation
[X] bug in Globe mode -> houses dont display going round ?
[X] Rendered continuous side bug!

[X] Magnification of Area implementation -> Place will define its magnification RATIO which is used to determine subplaces exact coordinates in a
	far more bigger area to move in!

[ ] world -> ai, place, object, faune, flora

[X] InputHandler -> create classic keyboard movement/turning which calls J3DCore render area renewal too
