[ ] spot light to the user in the night, doesnt work!!

[ ] user manual update

[ ] Lod modelling trees with billboard images captured in blender!

[ ] add Harek's table to the house


[ ] clean up climate and implement all parts of it with conditions, continue the work on it
[ ]	implement changing 3d models, how (updating some of the rendered nodes)? 
[ ] rain, fog, snow?


[ ] skySphere change: night sky based on calculated light value (v)
[ ] cloud planes on sky

[ ] clean up files in SVN

[ ] Wildlife should be generated based on Flora percentage given by flora generators??
	[ ] Wildlife -> animal kingdom with a chain of predating, complex fauna interaction rethinking

[?] Tree generation in java code? (billboard leaf quads!)
[?] Write the wind vertex program? Now it's cpu based!
[?] if no grass, don't put it on node!
[?] lens flare too intensive with bloom -> check what's to be done - no way to improve yet :-/

--
[X] billboard ngplant trees, hashmap based, BillboardPartsModel
[X] billboarding the grass! (rotation didnt help! :/)
[X] shadow render pass added! :-)
[-] Naive vegetation development? -> billboarding?? - Quad in other apps too!
[X] darkening veg -> mesh? or what?

[X] redraw Window model, it's too detailed on the lower part, unnecessarily
[X] grass kinds, sophisticated FloraSetup things!
[X] steeper mountain side is buggy with corners!!!

[X] CKeyAction camera settings, bad when looking up/down!

[X] finalize trees, create low level flora
[-] Test ImposterModel on FBO system
[-] ? Strip green from trees, create new Model type, SimpleTreeModel. Would define texture spatial type, plane.
	alpha state, texture etc.

[X] transparent texture finally working! Put some on the trees, collect some in your next journey to the wild ;)
[X] use LODModels!

[X] LODModel -> distanceSwitchedNode -> jungle, increase FPS with less detailed models
[X] ImposterNode http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=imposternode - lowest detail - rendered
[X] Billboard http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/wiki/doku.php?id=billboardnode&s=billboard
	

[X] lens flare!
[X] orbiter Suns/Moons each should have own Light direction (see j3dCore for more details on TODO)


[X] Time in engine -> skybox..

[X] jungle middle flora -> leaves, desert cactus model :)
[X] fall down where no GroundSubType! to steep for example!!
[X] Hill_steep.3ds is wrongly rotated! After that fix Mountain.java to user correct SIDES[] for steeps of diff. 
	directions. Then complete Movement Blocking in j3dcore for Climbing.
	
[X] Weather engine - implement Climate -> fauna - climate condition based forest/plain!
	[ ] Change flag for rendered thing!? -> example: climate change callback for already generated parts?


[X] mountain -> steep display all around a new ground level - movement up ahead on it!! + unpassable rockside generation
[X] bug in Globe mode -> houses dont display going round ?
[X] Rendered continuous side bug!

[X] Magnification of Area implementation -> Place will define its magnification RATIO which is used to determine subplaces exact coordinates in a
	far more bigger area to move in!

[ ] world -> ai, place, object, faune, flora

[X] InputHandler -> create classic keyboard movement/turning which calls J3DCore render area renewal too
