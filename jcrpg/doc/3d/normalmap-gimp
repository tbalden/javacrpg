(12:12:33 AM) Sindwiller: posterized the colors to a certain degree, then did "Alpha to Color" on the fuges
(12:12:34 AM) Sindwiller: night bughunter2
(12:12:50 AM) Sindwiller: then "Alpha Threshold" until the single stones were the only things visible
(12:12:57 AM) Sindwiller: corrected here and there
(12:13:02 AM) Sindwiller: copied the layer three times
(12:13:21 AM) Sindwiller: added a black-grey layer and merged it with the bottom layer
(12:14:00 AM) Sindwiller: then did 9x 9y gaussian blur on the bottom layer, 6x 6y blur on the middle layer and a little bit of blur on the top layer (I shouldn't have though)
(12:14:54 AM) Sindwiller: in the end, I ran the normalmap over the bottom layer with 4 Sample 34x scale, then on the middle layer, I did 12x scale or so, but not as a normalmap, but as a 8 bit (unsigned) D/U D/V map
(12:15:04 AM) Sindwiller: the top normalmap I did with 4x scale
(12:15:14 AM) Sindwiller: then changed the top two layers to Overlay
(12:15:20 AM) Sindwiller: voil√†
