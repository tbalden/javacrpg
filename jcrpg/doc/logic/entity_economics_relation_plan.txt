EntityInstances should be able to have homing point where they can build economics.

Examples: Wolfs -> den?
	Humanoids -> villages with houses
	
Economy parts should be available for groups of the instances so they can be related to each other. 
Economy parts dynamically follow the instance's needs -> bigger size more houses etc.

Modes should be added to EntityInstances:
Examples:
	Normal: groups living in they related economy part
	Defensive: groups can move around
	
These should be included in the calculation of encounters and which groups are encountered. (GroupingRule for such things extended.)
